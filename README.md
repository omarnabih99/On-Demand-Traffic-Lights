# On-Demand-Traffic-Lights
Embedded Systems project based on ATmega32 Microcontroller in Embedded Systems Professional track provided by Udacity and EGYFWD
• Traffic lights normally consist of three signals, transmitting meaning to drivers and riders through colors and symbols including arrows and bicycles.
• The system consists of 6 LEDs which are red, yellow, and green for both pedestrians and cars, arranged vertically or horizontally in that order in addition to an on-demand crosswalk button.
• Crosswalk button lets the signal operations know that someone is planning to cross the street, so the light adjusts, giving the pedestrian enough time to get across.
• MCAL drivers which are DIO, TIMERS, and INTERRUPTS, and ECUAL drivers which are LED and BUTTON were implemented from scratch.
• The project is developed using the full static architecture and follows the SOLID principles.
• The system consists of 6 LEDs, a push button, and AVR ATmega32 Microcontroller
• The project was developed using Eclipse IDE and simulated using Proteus Simulator
